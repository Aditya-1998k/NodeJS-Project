    <h1>Hello EveryOne</h1>
    <h2>My name is Aditya Gupta</h2>
    <p>here is my brief introduction:</p>
    <p>I have done b.tech from Galgotias college of Engineering <br> and Technology. The first time i was introduced to programming <br> in my first semester and after that i was so intrested in computer <br> science as i started exploring these Technology but my <br> domain was electrical engineering that is not my choice but <br> got it by rank. All my classmates and professors are related to electrical <br> engineering so i didn't got proper guidance but i started learning <br> programming language after c language i have learned java programming <br> but the same thing just because of proper guidance i just lost <br> into it. One day i came to know about 10x academy on my <br> which enthrilled me and i joined and now i am very happy that i am here</p>
